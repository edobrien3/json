        "description": "All patents expire eventually. Few continue to inspire 55 years later. Consider the Anser putter, patent #207.227, issued on March 21, 1967. Originally sketched by Karsten Solheim on a 78 rpm record sleeve before setting the standard in putter design, some of the first golfers to put it in play described it as a plumber’s nightmare. Until their dreams started coming true. Since then, it’s won more tournaments – including majors – than any other model. It also won the hearts and minds of other putter designers, who celebrated the day the patent expired. Today, we’re celebrating its contribution to making putting easier for everyone for the last 55 years.",
